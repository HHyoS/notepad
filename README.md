This code is a program that has been coded the floyd algorithm with Dynamic Programming.
When you enter the first number of nodes and the number of vertexs (ex - 3 5 3 = node, 5 = vertex), the start node, destination node, and the cost (ex - 1 2 5 means the cost from node 1 to node 2 is 5), the algorithm rotates and outputs the shortest distance (minimum cost) and the Short Path Array.
You must enter the number of vertexs entered for departure node, destination Jinoid, and cost.
