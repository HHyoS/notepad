MultiThread codes were written in the Ubuntu environment.
The code was implemented to see how the int count declared static volume in the critical area works in a multi-thread environment.
The parameters entered in the thread were set as structure and sent letters and numbers at the same time. When executed, 
the order of the threads was printed in reverse order and the order of the pthread_create was written in reverse order.
When running in Ubuntu, enter gcc [Current file name.c] -o [New file name] -lpthread.
